# Chest X-Ray14 Classification Project

**Note**: I am currently working on this repo. Therefore, some details may be absent for now.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust classification model for lung X-ray images using various deep learning architectures, including VGG, AlexNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and Inception. The goal is to accurately categorize X-ray images into 14 distinct classes while addressing challenges such as class imbalance within the dataset.

## Objectives

- Analyze and classify lung X-ray images into 14 categories.
- Investigate and address class imbalance in the dataset.
- Assess image quality based on blur, noise, contrast, and brightness levels.
- Apply digital image processing techniques to enhance problematic images.
- Compare the performance of different deep learning architectures.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Evaluate the quality of training images and identify problematic cases.
   - Implement image enhancement techniques to improve clarity and classification accuracy.

2. **Model Development:** 
   - Utilize VGG, AlexNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and Inception architectures.
   - Train and validate models on the processed dataset.

3. **Performance Comparison:** 
   - Analyze and compare the effectiveness of each architecture in classifying lung X-ray images.
   - Present findings and insights into model performance.
